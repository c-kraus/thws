# Classes
#### for title pages, fullscreen images, text sizing etc.


---

# What are classes

Classes change the styling of elements to look a certain way
You can apply these to slide by adding this code snippet before the slide content: 

``` 
<!-- _class: nameofclass -->
```

<bR> you can also add multiple classes like this:

``` 
<!-- _class: firstclass secondclass -->
```

---

# Types of classes
## Slide design
| classname | What it does |              
| --- | --- | 
| **titlepage** | with petrol background and special headings; *only use this once* |
| **structural** | for structural slides like intro, chapters, etc. |
| **fullscreen** | renders fullscreen image with special caption styling |
| **img_right** | renders image on the rights side with special caption styling |
| **end** | aligns elements at the end of the slide |
| **center** | aligns elements from the center of the slide |

---

# Types of classes
## Element alignment
At default all elements are aligned at the top of the slide. There may be use cases, when you want other options. <bR> Then you can use these classes:
| classname | What it does |              
| --- | --- | 
| **end** | aligns elements at the end of the slide |
| **center** | aligns elements from the center of the slide |

---

# Types of classes
## Text sizing

This is the default text size, but if you have content, which is a little longer you can change the text size by using these classes:

| classname | What it does |              
| --- | --- | 
| **tiny-text** | changes font size of text, lists, links and tables, please avoid using this class regularly |
| **small-text** | changes font size of text, lists, links |

#### Case Study 1
# img-right and small-text

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. <br> It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life.
